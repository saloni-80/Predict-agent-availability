# Predict-agent-availability

Predict time required to allot an agent to an issue

Predict agent availability
You have the following data for issues.
Issue
 - start_time
 - abandoned/resolved
 - answer_time	(time an agent started working on the issue)
 - resolved_time (the time an issue was resolved)
 - abandoned_time (if a customer left before the issue was assigned to an agent)
Now when a  new issue comes in we need to predict the time the issue will be assigned to an agent.
